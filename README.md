# Tool-wear-classification
In this project we are going to work on the classification method of Logistic Regression. We are going to : 1. Describe a set of images by means of a set region descriptors. 2. Using the computed descriptors, we are going to simulate a classification experiment and calculate some performance metrics from the results of the Logistic Regression classifier.
